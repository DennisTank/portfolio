# WELCOME TO MY PROFILE!!

Hi, My name is Dennis Tank.

My curiosity for cybersecurity led me to pursue a master's in Information Systems Security, where I’m building a strong foundation in core security principles and hands-on practices. With a background in software development, I’m passionate about applying my coding skills to areas like cloud security, secure systems design, and application hardening. From developing games to building websites and mobile apps, I’ve always been driven by creating real-world solutions—now I’m channeling that drive into building secure and resilient systems for the future.

Explore as much as you want. Enjoy!
